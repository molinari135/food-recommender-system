## Why are complex carbohydrates better than simple sugars?

EFSA differentiates between glycaemic carbohydrates, which are digested and absorbed in the small intestine, and dietary fiber, which consists of non-digestible carbohydrates passing to the large intestine. Complex carbohydrates, such as those found in whole grains and legumes, often contain dietary fiber, which contributes to various health benefits. In contrast, simple sugars are rapidly absorbed, leading to quick spikes in blood glucose levels.

[Source](https://www.efsa.europa.eu/en/efsajournal/pub/1462)

## What is the glycemic index, and why does it matter?

The glycemic index (GI) measures how quickly a carbohydrate-containing food raises blood glucose levels. EFSA has evaluated health claims related to slowly digestible starch (SDS) and its effect on post-prandial glycaemic responses. Foods with a lower GI, often containing higher amounts of SDS, induce significantly lower post-prandial glycaemic responses, which is beneficial for blood sugar management.

## How does excessive sugar consumption impact overall health?

EFSA has assessed the impact of dietary sugars on health and concluded that high intake of sugars, particularly from sugar-sweetened beverages, is associated with an increased risk of various health issues, including weight gain and dental caries. Limiting the intake of added sugars is recommended to maintain overall health.

## Are natural sugars (from fruit) better than added sugars?

EFSA acknowledges that while both natural and added sugars contribute to total sugar intake, the context in which they are consumed matters. Fruits provide natural sugars along with essential nutrients and dietary fiber, which can mitigate the rapid increase in blood glucose levels. In contrast, foods with added sugars often lack these beneficial nutrients.

## How does fiber help regulate blood sugar levels?

Dietary fiber, particularly soluble fiber, slows the digestion and absorption of carbohydrates, leading to a more gradual rise in blood glucose levels. EFSA has established dietary reference values for fiber intake, highlighting its role in improving glycaemic control and overall health.

[Source](https://www.efsa.europa.eu/en/efsajournal/pub/1462)

## What are the best sources of slow-digesting carbohydrates?

EFSA has evaluated health claims related to slowly digestible starch (SDS) and its benefits. Foods rich in SDS, such as certain whole grain products and legumes, induce lower post-prandial glycaemic responses, making them beneficial for blood sugar management.

## Why do some people need to take vitamin B12 supplements?

Vitamin B12 is essential for normal blood formation and neurological function. EFSA has set dietary reference values for vitamin B12 intake. Individuals following a strict plant-based diet may be at risk of vitamin B12 deficiency, as this vitamin is primarily found in animal products. In such cases, supplementation may be necessary to meet the recommended intake.

## How does diet influence the risk of developing diabetes?

EFSA has assessed the relationship between dietary factors and the risk of developing type 2 diabetes. Diets high in dietary fiber and whole grains are associated with a reduced risk, while high intakes of saturated fats and sugars are linked to an increased risk. Maintaining a balanced diet with appropriate energy intake is crucial for diabetes prevention.

## Can a high-fiber diet help prevent colon cancer?

The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) has evaluated the role of dietary fiber in health maintenance. While EFSA has not established a direct cause-and-effect relationship between high-fiber diets and the prevention of colon cancer, dietary fiber is recognized for its benefits in maintaining normal bowel function. EFSA recommends a daily intake of 25 grams of fiber for adults to support normal laxation.

## What foods can help boost the immune system?

Regarding immune system support, EFSA has acknowledged that certain nutrients contribute to its normal function. For instance, vitamin C is recognized for its role in maintaining the normal function of the immune system. Incorporating foods rich in vitamin C, such as fruits and vegetables, can help support immune health. It's important to note that while specific foods can contribute to the normal function of the immune system, EFSA emphasizes that overall dietary patterns and a balanced intake of essential nutrients are crucial for maintaining optimal health.
