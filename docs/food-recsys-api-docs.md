## Endpoints

### 1. Recommend Food
**Endpoint:** `/recommend`  
**Method:** `POST`  
**Description:** Recommends similar foods based on a given food item.

**Request Body:**

The request body requires:

- `food_name (str)`: the name of a food from the dataset `nutritional-facts.csv`
- `category (str)`: from the ones in `nutritional-facts.csv`
- `low_density (bool)`: the boolean value that allows to search low density similar foods, which is default, or just similar foods

```json
{
    "food_name": "Apple",
    "category": "Fruits",
    "low_density": true
}
```

**Response:**

The endpoint returns a response in a JSON format:
```json
{
    "similar_foods": [
        ["food_name", "cosine_similarity", "energy_density"]
    ]
}
```

where:

- `food_name (str)`: the name of the similar food from `nutritional-facts.csv`
- `cosine_similarity (int)`: the cosine similarity value of the food, if `low_density` is true, foods will be ordered first considering `energy_density` and then `cosine_similarity`, otherwise they will be ordered according to `cosine_similarity` only
- `energy_density`: the computed value of energy density, according to the formula $(\text{kcal} / 100g)$ considering that every nutritional facts are about 100g of food

```json

### 2. Recommend Cheat Meal
**Endpoint:** `/cheat`  
**Method:** `POST`  
**Description:** Recommends a cheat meal based on user fast food preferences.

```json
{
    "fast_food_preferences": ["Pizza", "Cheeseburger", "Hamburger"]

}
```

### 3. Justify Ingredients
**Endpoint:** `/justify`  
**Method:** `POST`  
**Description:** Provides a justification for choosing one meal over another based on nutritional information.

**Request Body:**

The request body requires:

- `meal_1 (list)`: a list of foods to compare in order to get the justification
- `meal_2 (list)`: a list of foods to compare in order to get the justification against the first list (they have to be one-to-one, e.g. the first element of `meal_1` will be compared with the first element of `meal_2`, and so on)

```json
{
    "meal_1": ["Pizza"],
    "meal_2": ["Pasta"]
}
```

**Response:**

The endpoint returns a response in a JSON format:

```json
{
  "justification": [
    {
      "comparison": "comparison",
      "persuasion": "persuasion",
      "food_1": "food_1",
      "food_2": "food_2",
      "score_1": "score_1",
      "score_2": "score_2"
    }
  ]
}
```

where:

- `comparison`: a message showing the macronutrient comparison between `food_1` and `food_2`
- `persuasion`: a message showing the strength and weaknesses of `food_1` and `food_2`, usually favouring `food_2`
- `food_1`: the food which is been compared against `food_2`
- `food_2`: the food which is been compared against `food_1`
- `score_1`: the score that `food_1` has won during the comparison 
- `score_2`: the score that `food_2` has won during the comparison 

The scoring system gives **1 point** to a food if:

- It has **less** calories, fats, or carbs
- It has **more** proteins, or fibers

There is a total of **5 points**, according to the number of macronutrients, which is an odd number to avoid "winning" issues.

```json
{
  "justification": [
    {
      "comparison": "**Comparing Pizza vs Pasta:**\n- Calories: Pizza has more (266), Pasta has less (131).\n- Carbs: Pizza has more (33), Pasta has less (25).\n- Fats: Pizza has more (9), Pasta has less (1).\n- Fiber: Pizza has more (2), Pasta has less (0).\n- Protein: Pizza has more (11), Pasta has less (5).\n",
      "persuasion": "\nðŸ‘‰ Pasta has a better macronutrient balance.\nðŸ”¥ If you're trying to lose weight, Pasta is a lighter choice.",
      "food_1": "Pizza",
      "food_2": "Pasta",
      "score_1": 2,
      "score_2": 3
    }
  ]
}
```
